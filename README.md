# Multivariate-Energy-Load-Forecasting

This notebook is based off of Vedant Jain's databricks blog, "Doing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Recurrent Neural Networks"

Here, I've experimented with a few LSTM architectures using mlflow to perform multivariate forecasting of household energy consumption, using several weather parameters like
room temperatures, wind speed, humidities etc
